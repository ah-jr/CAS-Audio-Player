CAS AudioPlayer - PATCH NOTES 
==============================================================================

v1.1:

  - DirectSound support added.
  - Added time/duration label.
  - Changed form size.
  - Added a button to turn on/off the Acrylic effect.
  - Shift + Wheel up/down on tracks now rearrange them.
  - Inserted tracks in a scrollbox
  - Changed level and speed controls to knobs.
  - Added button to switch trackbar to playlist/track's position.
  - Removed maximize button.
  - General changes in app's appearance. 

v1.0:
	
  - New Next/previous button
  - Added visualization of waveform of the tracks being played.
  - Added buttons to navigate between tracks, clone and remove.

v1.0b:

  - Rearranged project files.
  - Added TAcrylicTrack components.
  - Removed scroll panel.  

v1.0a:  
  
  - First usable version of the player. 
  - User must clone TAcrylicForm v1.1 and CAS-Engine v1.3 to compile 
    (see README.md).  
  - Must have an ASIO driver installed to play audio. 
    (easiest solution is ASIO4All).
  - Progress bar doesn't update yet due to a problem in the implementation of
    the audio callback. Apparently using PostMessage in the callback method
    can delay it on certain occasions. This will be fixed in version 1.0.
  - Buttons don't disable when the audio buffers are not ready. This will 
    also be fixed in version 1.0.
